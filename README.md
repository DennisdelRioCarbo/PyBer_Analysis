# PyBer_Analysis

##**Overview of the analysis**
- PyBer is a ride-sharing app company where we are analyzing all the rideshares data from January to early May of 2019 and create visualization for the CEO, V.Isualize, to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. V.Isualize has asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
 
##**Results**
- Description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different cities. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

From looking at the data on the **Summary DataFrame** we can see that the *urban* cities have the highest number of *Total Rides, Total Drivers* and *Total Fares*. Conversely the *urban* cities have the lowest *Average Fare per Ride* and *Average Fare per Driver*.

##**Summary**
- There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among city types.

1. Increase the number of drivers serving the rural and suburban cities.
2. Reduce the Fare to the urban cities to encourage more people to use PyBer in those areas.
3. Encourage urban drivers to serve suburban and rural cities as the average fare per Driver in those cities is higher.
