# PyBer_Analysis

##**Overview of the analysis**
- PyBer is a ride-sharing app company where we are analyzing all the rideshares data from January to early May of 2019 and create visualization for the CEO, V.Isualize, to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. V.Isualize has asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
 
##**Results**
- Description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different cities. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

From looking at the data on the **Summary DataFrame** we can see that there seems to be an inverse proportion between *Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares* and *Average Fare per Ride, Average Fare per Driver*. This could be explained by the relationship between supply and demand differences amongst the *Urban, Rural and Suburban* cities but also the distance travelled where *Rural* cities might have longer travelled distances, hence the higher fares.
*Urban* cities have the highest number of *Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares* followed by *Suburban* cities and *Rural* cities respectively.
Conversely *Rural* cities have the highest *Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver* followed by *Suburban* and *Urban* cities.
*Urban* cities bring in the highest revenue in *Total Fares* followed by *Sububran* and *Rural* cities respectively.

**SUMMARY DATAFRAME**

From the **PyBer Fare Summary** chart we can look at the following:
- Uptick in last week in February for all city types.
- Rural trend has remained mostly flat.
- Except for the uptick in last week of February for all three, the city types do not seem to move uniformly or show a clear relationship or pattern between them. 
 
##**Summary and recommendations**

Based on the data and the analysis we recommend the following:

1. Increase the number of drivers serving the rural and suburban cities.
2. Reduce the Fare to the urban cities to encourage more people to use PyBer in those areas.
3. Encourage urban drivers to serve suburban and rural cities as the average fare per Driver in those cities is higher.
4. Further analysis to study the relationship between demand for rides and supply of riders in the three city types and also the relationship between distance covered and fares.
5. Longer term data is required to try to uncover patterns for each city type and in-between them.
